# d3 Templates #
**Lindsay Edwards 2017***

A set of templates for easily plotting data using d3

### What is this repository for? ###

The purpose of these templates is to allow the creation of basic plots (e.g. scatter, coloured scatter, lineplot, barplot) using d3. These can either be used as is, or form the basis for more complex visualisations.  
The focus is on readability and consistency of the code.  

### How to use ###

1. For each plot type, the data file has the name of the plot, plus `-data.csv`. For example, for `simple-scatter`, the data should be saved as `simple-scatter-data.csv`, in the format of the existing file.
